```

## Prerequisites

Install and verify:

- Node.js 22.12 or later
- pnpm 11
- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- Git

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
docker --version
docker compose version
git --version
```

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/real-time-event-pipeline.git
cd real-time-event-pipeline
pnpm install
```

If pnpm asks you to approve the `esbuild` install script:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds esbuild
pnpm install
```

### 2. Create local secrets

Create the MongoDB replica-set keyfile used by the local Docker image:

```bash
mkdir -p docker/mongodb
openssl rand -base64 756 > docker/mongodb/mongo-keyfile
chmod 400 docker/mongodb/mongo-keyfile
```

Create the backend environment file:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Generate an admin API key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Paste the value into `backend/.env`:

```env
ADMIN_API_KEY=replace-with-your-generated-value
```

> Never commit `backend/.env` or `docker/mongodb/mongo-keyfile`.

### 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
pnpm infra:up
```

Check service status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Expected services:

```text
pipeline-zookeeper
pipeline-kafka
pipeline-mongodb
pipeline-clickhouse
pipeline-grafana
```

### 4. Initialize MongoDB replica set

Run once after MongoDB is healthy:

```bash
docker exec pipeline-mongodb mongosh \
  --username admin \
  --password password \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --eval 'rs.initiate({_id: "rs0", members: [{_id: 0, host: "localhost:27017"}]})'
```

Verify it is primary:

```bash
docker exec pipeline-mongodb mongosh \
  --username admin \
  --password password \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --eval 'rs.status().members.map(m => ({name: m.name, stateStr: m.stateStr}))'
```

Expected result:

```text
[{ name: 'localhost:27017', stateStr: 'PRIMARY' }]
```

### 5. Create the Kafka topic

```bash
docker exec pipeline-kafka kafka-topics \
  --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 \
  --create \
  --if-not-exists \
  --topic user-events \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 1
```

Verify it:

```bash
docker exec pipeline-kafka kafka-topics \
  --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 \
  --describe \
  --topic user-events
```

### 6. Start application services

In one terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev:backend
```

In another terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev:frontend
```

## Local URLs

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| React frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Node.js API health check | http://localhost:3001/api/health |
| Outbox status | http://localhost:3001/api/outbox/status |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 |
| ClickHouse HTTP | http://localhost:8123 |

Default Grafana credentials:

```text
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

## API

### Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Track an event

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "page_view",
    "userId": "user-001",
    "sessionId": "session-001",
    "properties": {
      "page": "/dashboard",
      "source": "curl"
    }
  }'
```

Successful requests return `202 Accepted` after the event and its outbox record commit in MongoDB.

### Outbox status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/outbox/status
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "counts": {
    "pending": 0,
    "processing": 0,
    "published": 23
  },
  "oldestPending": null,
  "recentFailures": []
}
```

### Manual outbox requeue

This endpoint is intended for local reliability and duplicate-delivery testing.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3001/api/admin/outbox/EVENT_ID/requeue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Manual duplicate-delivery test"
  }'
```

Requeueing an already-published record republishes the same `eventId`. This intentionally tests at-least-once delivery behavior.

## Outbox Design

The API does **not** write directly to MongoDB and Kafka in the request handler. Instead, it performs one MongoDB transaction:

```text
Transaction
    ├── Insert raw event into raw_events
    └── Insert pending Kafka payload into event_outbox
```

The background relay claims pending outbox records, publishes them to Kafka, and marks them `published`. If Kafka is unavailable, the relay stores the failure reason and retries with exponential backoff.

```text
pending → processing → published
            │
            └── failure → pending (retry later)
```

This gives the pipeline at-least-once publication to Kafka. Downstream consumers should use `eventId` as an idempotency key.

## ClickHouse Analytics

The Kafka table receives JSON timestamp values as strings. The materialized view converts them into `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')` values before inserting into the durable MergeTree analytics table.

Verify the analytics row count:

```bash
docker exec pipeline-clickhouse clickhouse-client \
  --user default \
  --password password \
  --query "SELECT count() FROM analytics.events_analytics"
```

Inspect recent events:

```bash
docker exec pipeline-clickhouse clickhouse-client \
  --user default \
  --password password \
  --query "
    SELECT
      eventId,
      eventType,
      userId,
      eventTimestamp,
      receivedAt
    FROM analytics.events_analytics
    ORDER BY receivedAt DESC
    LIMIT 20
  "
```

## Grafana Panels

Configure the ClickHouse data source with:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Server address | `clickhouse` |
| Port | `8123` |
| Protocol | `HTTP` |
| Database | `analytics` |
| Username | `default` |
| Password | `password` |

Recommended panels:

### Events per minute

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfMinute(eventTimestamp) AS time,
  count() AS events
FROM analytics.events_analytics
WHERE $__timeFilter(eventTimestamp)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time ASC
```

### Events by type

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfMinute(eventTimestamp) AS time,
  eventType AS metric,
  count() AS events
FROM analytics.events_analytics
WHERE $__timeFilter(eventTimestamp)
GROUP BY time, metric
ORDER BY time ASC, metric ASC
```

### Top event types

```sql
SELECT
  eventType,
  count() AS events
FROM analytics.events_analytics
WHERE $__timeFilter(eventTimestamp)
GROUP BY eventType
ORDER BY events DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Analytics Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard visualizes real-time event throughput, event-type distribution, recent event activity, and ClickHouse-backed analytics.

![Grafana dashboard showing events per minute, event types, top event types, and recent pipeline events](screenshots/grafana-dashboard.png)

The dashboard reads from `analytics.events_analytics`, which is populated through the Kafka → ClickHouse materialized-view ingestion path.

### Pipeline reconciliation

The project includes separate operational and analytics checks:

```text
MongoDB outbox published count:  23
ClickHouse analytics row count: 23
```

This confirms published outbox events are reaching Kafka and persisting in ClickHouse.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/outbox/status

docker exec pipeline-clickhouse clickhouse-client \
  --user default \
  --password password \
  --query "SELECT count() FROM analytics.events_analytics"
```

## Testing Failure Recovery

Stop Kafka:

```bash
docker compose stop kafka
```

Send an event with `POST /api/track`. The API should still return `202 Accepted`, while `/api/outbox/status` shows a pending or processing record with retry details.

Restart Kafka:

```bash
docker compose start kafka
```

The relay should retry, publish the event, and eventually return the outbox record to `published`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Type-check all workspace packages
pnpm typecheck

# Build all workspace packages
pnpm build

# Start or stop local infrastructure
pnpm infra:up
pnpm infra:down

# Follow infrastructure logs
pnpm infra:logs

# Start development services
pnpm dev:backend
pnpm dev:frontend

# Inspect Compose services
docker compose ps

# Reset all local infrastructure data (destructive)
docker compose down -v
```

## Testing and CI

The project includes unit and end-to-end tests for the full event pipeline.

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Start infrastructure and backend in separate terminals
pnpm infra:up
pnpm dev:backend

# Run the MongoDB → outbox → Kafka → ClickHouse integration suite
pnpm test:integration
```

GitHub Actions runs the same backend type-check, production build, unit tests, and end-to-end pipeline tests on every push and pull request.

The CI workflow starts a clean Docker environment, initializes the MongoDB replica set, creates the `user-events` Kafka topic, starts ClickHouse, launches the compiled backend, and verifies event delivery through the analytics pipeline.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add `schemaVersion` to every event contract
